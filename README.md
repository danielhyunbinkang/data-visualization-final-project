## Health System Capacity and Life Expectancy Across Countries

This project explores how differences in healthcare infrastructure across countries relate to variation in life expectancy over time. Using publicly available World Bank World Development Indicators, the analysis examines patterns in life expectancy alongside measures of health system capacity, including physician density and hospital bed availability.

## Research Question
How do differences in healthcare infrastructure across countries relate to variation in life expectancy over time?

## Data
All data come from the World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI):
- Life expectancy at birth (SP.DYN.LE00.IN)
- Physicians per 1,000 people (SH.MED.PHYS.ZS)
- Hospital beds per 1,000 people (SH.MED.BEDS.ZS)

The data are aggregated at the country-year level and contain no personal or sensitive information.
